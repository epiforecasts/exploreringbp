# Explore the feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts

This application allows interactive exploration of individual contact tracing and isolation scenarios for the 2019-nCoV outbreak using the branching process model developed in ["Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts"](https://cmmid.github.io/ncov/isolation_contact_tracing/) by Hellewell et al. For more details on the model used or the scenarios considered please see the paper.

## Running the app

Install the application and required dependencies with the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/exploreringbp", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Run the app locally.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
exploreringbp::run_app()
```

## Usage

The results tab contains a summary of a single outbreak scenario.

```{r,width = "65%", echo = FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/results.png")
```

The settings tab contains sliders which can be used to vary the outbreak scenario.

```{r,width = "65%", echo = FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/settings.png")
```


The details tab contains a brief overview of the model used in the app and links to resources for further information.

```{r,width = "65%", echo = FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/details.png")
```

## Docker


This app was developed in a docker container based on the tidyverse docker image. 

To build the docker image run (from the `exploreringbp` directory):

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker build . -t exploreringbp
```

To run the docker image run:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 --name exploreringbp -e USER=exploreringbp -e PASSWORD=exploreringbp exploreringbp
```

The rstudio client can be found on port :8787 at your local machines ip. The default username:password is exploreringbp:exploreringbp, set the user with -e USER=username, and the password with - e PASSWORD=newpasswordhere.
